## 1. Background & Context

Ashraf (33, Egyptian) has motorway driving phobia following a near-miss accident approximately 3 years ago. He attended an informational session on 31 January 2025, then enrolled in a reduced-cost three-session training package. Previous work (Sessions 1 & 2, Jan 2026) established the target memory and achieved partial desensitisation (SUDS 8→3, VOC 2→4). Shame component noted ("being a grown man who can't drive like everyone else"). This session continues reprocessing with a reframed target image incorporating his supportive brother.

---

## 2. Phase 3: Assessment

### 2.1 Target Memory/Image

Driving on the motorway with his supportive brother in the passenger seat. Merging onto the slip road, accelerating, feeling increasingly out of control. Physiological reactions: shallow breathing, near-hyperventilation. Recurring thought: *"How can I get off?"* The presence of his brother provides a supportive element to the scene.

### 2.2 Cognitions

| Type | Statement |
|------|-----------|
| **Negative cognition (NC)** | "I am not in control." |
| **Positive cognition (PC)** | "I feel in control and comfortable driving." |

### 2.3 Validity of Cognition (VOC) Scale (1–7)

- **Initial VOC:** 2/7 — *"I feel in control and comfortable driving"* felt largely untrue at session start.

### 2.4 Subjective Units of Distress (SUDS) Scale (0–10)

- **Initial SUDS:** 8/10 — Significant distress when holding the image and NC.

### 2.5 Body Sensations

Client reported tension in chest, shallow breathing, and tightness in shoulders when focusing on the target.

## 3. Phase 4: Desensitisation

### 3.1 Processing Parameters

- **Stimulation:** Combination of visual (BilateralBase), auditory, and tactile (shoulder tapping)
- **Set duration:** ~50 seconds per set
- **Total sets:** 18

### 3.2 SUDS & VOC Passes (EMDR Protocol)

| Pass | Sets | SUDS (0–10) | VOC (1–7) | Notes |
|------|------|-------------|-----------|-------|
| Baseline | — | 8 | 2 | Image + NC held; high distress |
| 1 | 1–4 | 7 | 2 | Slight reduction; image feels "heavy" |
| 2 | 5–8 | 6 | 3 | Breathing easier; brother's presence noted as calming |
| 3 | 9–12 | 4 | 4 | Image "more distant"; less physiological arousal |
| 4 | 13–15 | 2 | 5 | Client reports "I can see a way through" |
| 5 | 16–18 | 0 | 6 | **SUDS 0 achieved.** Image feels neutral; "I can do this" |
| Post-installation | — | 0 | 7 | **VOC 7.** PC fully installed; "I feel in control and comfortable driving" |

### 3.3 Processing Summary

- **SUDS trajectory:** 8 → 7 → 6 → 4 → 2 → **0**
- **VOC trajectory:** 2 → 2 → 3 → 4 → 5 → 6 → **7**

Client engaged well with bilateral stimulation. New material emerged: anger at the other driver ("not paying attention"), awareness of screeching tyres, and a shift toward self-compassion ("I'm not alone in the car"). The supportive brother's presence was integrated into the reprocessing. Stabilisation techniques (breathing, safe place) were used briefly when client became overwhelmed mid-session. No blocking; processing flowed to completion.

## 4. Phase 5: Installation

| Step | PC | VOC |
|------|-----|-----|
| Pre-installation check | "I feel in control and comfortable driving" | 6 |
| Installation sets | 3 sets × ~50 sec | — |
| Post-installation | "I feel in control and comfortable driving" | **7** |

Client reported the PC felt "completely true" and "like it belongs to me now."

---

## 5. Phase 6: Body Scan

Client scanned body while holding image + PC. No residual tension. Reported feeling "calm" and "grounded."

---

## 6. Phase 7: Closure

- Client left in a stable state.
- Brief psychoeducation on possible between-session processing.
- Reminder of between-session work: practise breathing before/after challenging drives; note situations of control.

---

## 7. Phase 8: Re-evaluation (Next Session)

- Re-check SUDS and VOC for this target.
- If stable at 0/7, consider addressing shame component as separate target if indicated.
- Plan for future motorway exposure if client wishes.

---

## 8. Clinical Notes

- Shame component ("grown man who can't drive") was present but did not block processing. May require separate targeting if it resurfaces.
- Imagery-enhancement strategies discussed in prior session appeared helpful; client maintained clearer mental imagery.
- Supervision question from Jan 2026 addressed: continued processing of primary target to SUDS 0 was effective before considering shame as separate target.
