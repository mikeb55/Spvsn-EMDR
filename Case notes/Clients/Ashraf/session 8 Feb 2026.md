# Session notes – 8 February 2026 (Session 1)

**Client:** Ashraf  
**Date:** 8 February 2026 (Session 1)

## Background

Ashraf first attended a 30‑minute informational session on 31 January 2025. During that meeting, EMDR procedures were explained and a brief demonstration was given using the BilateralBase software. After some consideration, he contacted me expressing his wish to proceed and enrolled in a reduced‑cost three‑session training package offered to student participants.

## Target Memory/Image

Driving on a motorway, merging onto a slip road, accelerating while feeling increasingly out of control. He reported physiological reactions such as shallow breathing and near‑hyperventilation, alongside the recurring thought: "How can I get off?"

---

## Cognitions

- **Negative cognition:** "I feel extremely scared."
- **Positive cognition (installation target):** "I feel in control."

---

## SUDS (Subjective Units of Distress Scale)

- **Before processing:** 10  
- **After processing:** 8  

There was noticeable but limited improvement. Ashraf reported slightly reduced tension and a small shift in his sense of agency, though he remained uneasy when visualizing the scenario.

## Processing Summary

Completed 10 EMDR sets, each lasting approximately 50 seconds. Utilized a combination of visual, auditory, and tactile (shoulder tapping) stimulation methods. Ashraf engaged well with the process but found it difficult to maintain clear mental imagery, reporting more sensations and feelings than visual detail. Despite this challenge, he demonstrated some capacity to remain present and tolerate the anxiety through the sets.

## Observations and Plan

- Minimal but encouraging progress noted; distress levels still high.
- Discussed possible imagery‑enhancement strategies to support next session's work.
- Plan to revisit the same target image and continue stabilisation work before deeper reprocessing.
