# Ashraf – Case Summary: Sessions 1 & 2 (Jan 2026)

**4 Main Points for EMDR Supervision Feedback:**

1. **Client Presentation:** 33-year-old Egyptian man with motorway driving phobia following a near-miss accident 3 years ago. Clear target memory established: seeing spinning car hit barrier. SUDs 8/10, VOC 2/7. Shame component present ("being a grown man who can't drive like everyone else").

2. **Processing Progress:** After Phase 4 desensitisation, SUDs reduced from 8 to 3. VOC increased from 2 to 4. New material emerged: anger at the other driver for "not paying attention" and awareness of screeching tyres. Client reports image now feels "more distant, like watching it in a film."

3. **Clinical Management:** Successfully used stabilisation techniques (breathing, safe place) when client became overwhelmed during processing. Between-session work assigned: practise breathing before/after challenging drives and note situations of control.

4. **Shame Component:** The shame about being unable to drive "like everyone else" may need separate targeting or cognitive interweaves addressing self-defectiveness, particularly if processing stalls or if the shame becomes a barrier to continued work.

**Question for Working Forward:** Given that shame emerged as a significant component alongside the fear, should we continue processing the original motorway accident target until SUDs reach 0, or would it be more effective to address the shame as a separate target once the primary fear has been further reduced?
