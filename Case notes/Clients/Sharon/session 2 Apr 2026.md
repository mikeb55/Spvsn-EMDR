## Background

This was Sharon's first full EMDR session following a previous 30‑minute introductory meeting. In that earlier conversation, she described vivid images related to experiences of domestic violence from her ex‑husband. The marriage ended in divorce in October 2025. Sharon is a mother of four: a 26‑year‑old son (living independently), a 21‑year‑old daughter who occasionally tries to talk about feelings with her, and two younger daughters aged 11 and 9. Sharon tends to withhold emotional discussion, particularly with her adult daughter, stating she prefers "not to burden" her children.

## Target Memory/Image

Being slapped in the face by her ex‑husband.

---

## Cognitions

- **Negative cognition:** "I am powerless."
- **Positive cognition (installation target):** "I am capable."

---

## SUDS (Subjective Units of Distress Scale)

- **Before processing:** 10  
- **After processing:** 7  

*Note:* The intensity decreased somewhat but not fully; residual emotional charge remains, particularly around feelings of helplessness and shame.

---

## Processing Summary

Conducted 12 bilateral stimulation sets. Sharon displayed moderate engagement throughout and reported emerging bodily sensations (tightness in chest, trembling in hands). She was able to maintain dual awareness but required brief grounding after set 8 due to tearfulness. She described partial relief and said the image felt "a bit more distant" by the end of the session.

## Plan for Next Session

1. Continue processing residual distress linked to the same target memory.
2. Reassess SUDS to monitor further reduction.
3. Begin preparation for addressing associated beliefs around self‑efficacy and safety.
