# The 8 Phases of EMDR Therapy

## 1. History and Treatment Planning
- Client history taking
- Trauma assessment
- Treatment planning

## 2. Preparation
- Building therapeutic rapport
- Explaining EMDR process
- Teaching coping skills and stabilization techniques

## 3. Assessment
- Identifying target memory
- Establishing negative belief
- Establishing positive belief
- Identifying emotions
- Identifying body sensations
- Establishing SUD (Subjective Units of Disturbance) scale
- Establishing VoC (Validity of Cognition) scale

## 4. Desensitization
- Bilateral stimulation (eye movements, taps, or sounds)
- Processing the target memory
- Reducing emotional disturbance

## 5. Installation
- Strengthening the positive belief
- Holding the target memory while installing positive cognition

## 6. Body Scan
- Checking for residual physical tension
- Identifying any remaining body sensations
- Processing any remaining physical responses

## 7. Closure
- Returning client to calm state
- May use container or safe place techniques
- Ensuring client is stable before ending session

## 8. Reevaluation
- Reviewing progress from previous session
- Assessing remaining targets
- Planning next steps in treatment

## AIP - Adaptive Information Processing

**AIP** stands for **Adaptive Information Processing**.

It's the theoretical model that underlies EMDR therapy, developed by Francine Shapiro. The model proposes that the brain has a natural system for processing traumatic memories and storing them adaptively when functioning normally. When trauma disrupts this process, the memory can remain unprocessed and cause symptoms. EMDR aims to restore adaptive processing so the memory can be stored in a healthier way.

## How Psychoeducation Feeds AIP

Psychoeducation supports the AIP model by:
- Educating clients about how trauma affects the brain and memory processing
- Explaining why memories may feel "stuck" or unprocessed
- Helping clients understand that their symptoms are normal responses to trauma, not personal failures
- Providing a framework for understanding how EMDR works to restore natural processing
- Reducing shame and self-blame by normalizing trauma responses
- Building client confidence in the brain's natural healing capacity
- Creating a foundation of understanding that allows clients to trust the EMDR process

## 3 Prongs - Past, Present, Future

EMDR treatment follows a three-pronged approach:

1. **Past** - Processing past traumatic memories and events that are the root cause of current symptoms
2. **Present** - Addressing current triggers and situations that activate the unprocessed memories
3. **Future** - Installing positive templates for future adaptive responses and behaviors

## Assessment Phase

Assessment refers to assessment of the target memory. Could also be called 'activation'.

## Train Metaphor (Phase 2 - Preparation)

In Phase 2, we often refer to the 'train metaphor'. The train needs to be moving. My job as EMDR practitioner is to activate the train moving and check in. The client can decide which direction the train moves. The practitioner stays out of the way of the train, but helps it get moving if the 'train' is stuck.

## Phase 3 (Assessment) - Important Notes

We only do Phase 3 if we have time to do Phase 4. First question to ask is: 'What still image represents the worst part of the image WHEN IT HAPPENED (back then)?' Then ask for a Negative Cognition and a Positive Cognition. Cognitions can be about: safety, control, self defectiveness, or responsibility.

## Scales for Negative and Positive Cognition

**SUD (Subjective Units of Disturbance)** - Used to measure the level of distress when holding the negative cognition with the target memory
- Scale: 0-10 (0 = no disturbance, 10 = worst possible)

**VoC (Validity of Cognition)** - Used to measure how true/valid the positive cognition feels when holding the target memory
- Scale: 1-7 (1 = completely false, 7 = completely true)

## TICES Acronym

**TICES** is a self-monitoring tool used in EMDR therapy to identify and track emotional triggers and reactions:

- **T** - Trigger (what happened or set things off) - Helps identify the present trigger that activates the unprocessed memory
- **I** - Image (what image or memory flashed through your mind) - The target memory image that represents the worst part when it happened (back then)
- **C** - Cognition (what you told yourself - negative beliefs) - The negative cognition about safety, control, self defectiveness, or responsibility
- **E** - Emotion (what feelings came up) - The emotions associated with the target memory that need to be processed
- **S** - Sensation (what you noticed in your body) - Body sensations that indicate where the trauma is stored physically

The TICES log helps identify specific triggers causing strong reactions, recognise unprocessed memories fuelling current emotions, and see patterns in responses.

## Phase 4 - Desensitisation and Reprocessing

Desensitising and reprocessing is done in Phase 4.
