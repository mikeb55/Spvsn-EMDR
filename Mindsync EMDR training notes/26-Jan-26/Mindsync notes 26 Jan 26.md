# The 8 Phases of EMDR Therapy

## 1. History and Treatment Planning
- Client history taking
- Trauma assessment
- Treatment planning

## 2. Preparation
- Building therapeutic rapport
- Explaining EMDR process
- Teaching coping skills and stabilization techniques

## 3. Assessment
- Identifying target memory
- Establishing negative belief
- Establishing positive belief
- Identifying emotions
- Identifying body sensations
- Establishing SUD (Subjective Units of Disturbance) scale
- Establishing VoC (Validity of Cognition) scale

## 4. Desensitization
- Bilateral stimulation (eye movements, taps, or sounds)
- Processing the target memory
- Reducing emotional disturbance

## 5. Installation
- Strengthening the positive belief
- Holding the target memory while installing positive cognition

## 6. Body Scan
- Checking for residual physical tension
- Identifying any remaining body sensations
- Processing any remaining physical responses

## 7. Closure
- Returning client to calm state
- May use container or safe place techniques
- Ensuring client is stable before ending session

## 8. Reevaluation
- Reviewing progress from previous session
- Assessing remaining targets
- Planning next steps in treatment

## AIP - Adaptive Information Processing

**AIP** stands for **Adaptive Information Processing**.

It's the theoretical model that underlies EMDR therapy, developed by Francine Shapiro. The model proposes that the brain has a natural system for processing traumatic memories and storing them adaptively when functioning normally. When trauma disrupts this process, the memory can remain unprocessed and cause symptoms. EMDR aims to restore adaptive processing so the memory can be stored in a healthier way.

## How Psychoeducation Feeds AIP

Psychoeducation supports the AIP model by:
- Educating clients about how trauma affects the brain and memory processing
- Explaining why memories may feel "stuck" or unprocessed
- Helping clients understand that their symptoms are normal responses to trauma, not personal failures
- Providing a framework for understanding how EMDR works to restore natural processing
- Reducing shame and self-blame by normalizing trauma responses
- Building client confidence in the brain's natural healing capacity
- Creating a foundation of understanding that allows clients to trust the EMDR process

## 3 Prongs - Past, Present, Future

EMDR treatment follows a three-pronged approach:

1. **Past** - Processing past traumatic memories and events that are the root cause of current symptoms
2. **Present** - Addressing current triggers and situations that activate the unprocessed memories
3. **Future** - Installing positive templates for future adaptive responses and behaviors

## Assessment Phase

Assessment refers to assessment of the target memory. Could also be called 'activation'.

## Train Metaphor (Phase 2 - Preparation)

In Phase 2, we often refer to the 'train metaphor'. The train needs to be moving. My job as EMDR practitioner is to activate the train moving and check in. The client can decide which direction the train moves. The practitioner stays out of the way of the train, but helps it get moving if the 'train' is stuck.

## Phase 3 (Assessment) - Important Notes

We only do Phase 3 if we have time to do Phase 4. First question to ask is: 'What still image represents the worst part of the image WHEN IT HAPPENED (back then)?' Then ask for a Negative Cognition and a Positive Cognition. Cognitions can be about: safety, control, self defectiveness, or responsibility.

## Scales for Negative and Positive Cognition

**SUD (Subjective Units of Disturbance)** - Used to measure the level of distress when holding the negative cognition with the target memory
- Scale: 0-10 (0 = no disturbance, 10 = worst possible)

**VoC (Validity of Cognition)** - Used to measure how true/valid the positive cognition feels when holding the target memory
- Scale: 1-7 (1 = completely false, 7 = completely true)

## TICES Acronym

**TICES** is a self-monitoring tool used in EMDR therapy to identify and track emotional triggers and reactions:

- **T** - Trigger (what happened or set things off) - Helps identify the present trigger that activates the unprocessed memory
- **I** - Image (what image or memory flashed through your mind) - The target memory image that represents the worst part when it happened (back then)
- **C** - Cognition (what you told yourself - negative beliefs) - The negative cognition about safety, control, self defectiveness, or responsibility
- **E** - Emotion (what feelings came up) - The emotions associated with the target memory that need to be processed
- **S** - Sensation (what you noticed in your body) - Body sensations that indicate where the trauma is stored physically

The TICES log helps identify specific triggers causing strong reactions, recognise unprocessed memories fuelling current emotions, and see patterns in responses.

## Phase 4 - Desensitisation and Reprocessing

Desensitising and reprocessing is done in Phase 4.

**Caroline van Diest - SUD checking during Phase 4:** Never ask the SUD unless you are at 1 or 2 SUD. This means: During processing in Phase 4, don't repeatedly interrupt the client by asking "What's your SUD now?" Let the processing flow naturally. Only check the SUD when you suspect it's down to 1 or 2 (or 0), indicating the memory has been mostly processed. This maintains the natural flow of processing and doesn't interrupt the client's healing process.

## Phase 5 (Installation) - Important Note

Don't look for a positive cognition in Phase 5 unless you have a 0 SUD. The positive cognition installation should only happen once the memory has been fully desensitised (SUD = 0). Then ask if the positive cognition is still relevant or if we need to update it.

## Phase 6 - The Body Scan

Scan your body from head to toe and tell me what's going on now.

## Phase 7 (Closure) - Incomplete Processing Session

One type of closure is an incomplete processing session (Phase 4). Realistically the closing is the same. Use this wording: 'You may find that you still are focusing on this. If you notice things you haven't been thinking about before, bring it to the next session. In the meantime use all your strategies that you have learned before'. The point is to prepare them for how to cope in between sessions. Then in the next session, do a review. Re-evaluate if things are progressing. Re-evaluate if we need a new target. Then say: "Connect to the memory. What's there now?" Don't refer to the previous image, but what's there now. Ask how much charge is in the memory - not about fears going forward.

## Cognitive Interweaves

Cognitive interweaves are strategic therapeutic interventions used in EMDR when processing becomes stuck or blocked during Phase 4 (Desensitisation). When the client's natural processing has stalled and they're unable to move forward, the therapist introduces information, questions, or perspectives that help connect the stuck material to adaptive information networks. This technique helps unblock processing and allows the client's natural healing process to resume.

Sometimes you need a key when stuck - just a few key words. We just want to 'jump start the train'. We may offer something to elicit a diversion from the stuck point.

**When do we use cognitive interweaves? Four examples:**

1. When processing loops and the client keeps reporting the same material without change
2. When the client is stuck in a negative belief and can't access adaptive information
3. When the client lacks necessary information or resources to process the memory
4. When the client is overwhelmed and needs help connecting to adaptive networks

**Cognitive Interweaves need to be relevant**

- The interweave needs to be relevant to the blockage
- If the client is stuck feeling unsafe, the interweave needs to be about safety
- If the client is stuck with self defectiveness, it needs to be relevant to the self defectiveness
- If the tracks are blocked: you need something appropriate to unblock them. We are not going to clear the tracks of a fallen tree with chopsticks, we need a crane or chainsaw. The interweave may help lay new tracks

**Examples of cognitive interweaves a skilled practitioner might say:**

1. "Whose responsibility was that really?"
2. "What would you tell a child in this situation?"
3. "You're safe now. That was then, this is now."
4. "What do you know now that you didn't know then?"
5. "If this happened to someone you love, what would you say to them?"
6. "What would you do differently if this happened today?"

## How to Deliver an Interweave

- The client is observed to be stuck in the processing...
- The therapist offered the interweave (short question/statement)
- The client may respond (you may not always like the response)
- The therapist encourages the client to just notice
- Complete a set of DABLS (Fast)
- As usual: "what do you notice now?"

**Note:** A long discussion/socratic questioning, guided discovery or 20 mins of psycho education is NOT a cognitive interweave

## Cognitive Interweaves are Often Linked to Domains

- Linking the dysfunctional information that is frozen in the system to the adaptive information stored in the "healthier network" (present day, age related, rational, narrative information – story)
  - Safety/vulnerability
  - Self defectiveness
  - Responsibility. Action.
  - Choice/control

## Safety

A client might be stuck in the moment of the trauma when they are unsafe.

- Are you safe now?
- Did you survive?
- Are there any hands around your throat now?
- How did you get away?
- What happened next?
- Can you do something now that you couldn't do then?

## Control/Choice

A client might be stuck thinking they should have done something different, e.g. a date rape victim should have not gone on a date.

- Did you have all the information then?
- Knowing now how this happens would you make the same choice?
- What would you like to have said?
- Could you make the decision where you go after school?
- What would you have done if you had control?

## Responsibility

A client might be stuck thinking it was their fault.

- Can a child really be held accountable for following the adult choices?
- I'm confused interweave. I don't understand how it would be possible for you to choose to do something when there was no one to support you?
- How could you see the future before it happened?
- Look at that photo of you at 9 years old – how knowledgeable does she/he look?
- Who was responsible ...you or him?
- Did you intend for it to happen?

## Self Defectiveness

Stuck with believing I am a bad person.

- Is it fair to blame a 6 year old child?
- Being a teenager is such a difficult time, would you tell your teen they are evil and don't deserve love?
- What were you missing that would have helped you know you were good enough?
- Would you want someone else to feel like this had they been in that situation?

## Imaginative Interweaves

Sometimes the system needs an invitation to play out a different action... imagine it in a way you would have liked it to be.

- "I wish I had said to that teacher".... "That's okay, what would you have said?" Imagine yourself saying that.
- "I would have held her and said goodbye, if I had known she would die that night." "Ok let's connect with what you would like to have said and done"

Bring in a protector figure, a resource.

- Helicopter above the situation, look at the whole scene, what do you see?
- Use another person - a backdoor interweave - what would your best friend/mother etc say?
- Kintsugi

## Example: Cognitive Interweaves for Teenager Feeling Responsible for Father's Accident

**Scenario:** An older teenager asked her dad to take her ice skating. Her dad then had an accident and she feels (erroneously) that she is responsible.

**Examples of cognitive interweaves the EMDR practitioner could say:**

- "Whose responsibility was it really to drive safely?"
- "Did you intend for the accident to happen?"
- "How could you see the future before it happened?"
- "Can a teenager really be held accountable for an adult's driving decisions?"
- "Who was responsible for the accident - you or the driver?"
- "What would you tell a friend if this happened to them?"
- "If this happened to someone you love, what would you say to them?"
- "Would you want someone else to feel like this had they been in that situation?"
- "Did you have all the information then about what could happen?"
- "What do you know now that you didn't know then?"
- "How could you have known the accident would happen?"
- "Could you control whether the accident happened?"
- "What would you have done differently if you had control over the situation?"

## Example: Cognitive Interweaves for Client Feeling Guilty About Wanting to Play When Mom Was Dying

**Scenario:** Client in their 40s. Mom died of breast cancer when they were 11. They wanted to play and feels guilty about it.

**Examples of cognitive interweaves the EMDR practitioner could say:**

- "Can an 11 year old child really be held accountable for wanting to play?"
- "Is it fair to blame an 11 year old child?"
- "How could you see the future before it happened?"
- "Did you intend for your mom to die?"
- "What were you missing that would have helped you know what to do?"
- "Would you want someone else to feel like this had they been in that situation?"
- "What would you tell an 11 year old child in this situation?"
- "If this happened to someone you love, what would you say to them?"
- "Look at that photo of you at 11 years old – how knowledgeable does she/he look?"
- "What do you know now that you didn't know then?"
- "Could you control whether your mom had cancer?"
- "Could an 11 year old make the decision about how to spend their time?"
- "What would you have done if you had control?"

## Example: Cognitive Interweaves for Client Feeling Guilty About Mother's Domestic Violence

**Scenario:** Client in their 40s processing domestic violence. Mother almost died from step father. Client feels guilty.

**Examples of cognitive interweaves the EMDR practitioner could say:**

- "Who was responsible for the violence - you or your stepfather?"
- "Could you control whether your stepfather was violent?"
- "What would you tell a child in this situation?"
- "How could you have stopped an adult from being violent?"
- "Did you intend for your mother to be hurt?"
- "What would your mother want you to feel about this?"
- "If your mother could see you now, what would she say to you?"
- "What would you have done if you had the power of an adult back then?"

## EMDR Integration with Other Therapeutic Modes

EMDR can be used interchangeably with other therapeutic modes.

## Case Summary: Ashraf - Sessions 1 & 2 (Jan 2026)

**4 Main Points for EMDR Supervision Feedback:**

1. **Client Presentation:** 33-year-old Egyptian man with motorway driving phobia following a near-miss accident 3 years ago. Clear target memory established: seeing spinning car hit barrier. SUDs 8/10, VOC 2/7. Shame component present ("being a grown man who can't drive like everyone else").

2. **Processing Progress:** After Phase 4 desensitisation, SUDs reduced from 8 to 3. VOC increased from 2 to 4. New material emerged: anger at the other driver for "not paying attention" and awareness of screeching tyres. Client reports image now feels "more distant, like watching it in a film."

3. **Clinical Management:** Successfully used stabilisation techniques (breathing, safe place) when client became overwhelmed during processing. Between-session work assigned: practise breathing before/after challenging drives and note situations of control.

4. **Shame Component:** The shame about being unable to drive "like everyone else" may need separate targeting or cognitive interweaves addressing self-defectiveness, particularly if processing stalls or if the shame becomes a barrier to continued work.

**Question for Working Forward:** Given that shame emerged as a significant component alongside the fear, should we continue processing the original motorway accident target until SUDs reach 0, or would it be more effective to address the shame as a separate target once the primary fear has been further reduced?

## Cognitive Interweaves for Autistic Clients - Adaptations

**Question:** How could I ask an autistic person who can't feel their emotions an interweave for seeing only black or white when processing?

**Adapted cognitive interweaves for autistic clients:**

**For black/white visual stuck point:**
- "What's between the black and white?"
- "If you could zoom out, what else might be in the picture?"
- "What would happen if you added one colour to the black and white?"
- "Can you describe what the black represents and what the white represents?"

**Body sensation-based (instead of emotion-focused):**
- "What do you notice in your body right now?"
- "Where do you feel the black/white - in your chest, stomach, head?"
- "Does the black feel heavy or light?"
- "What temperature is the white - hot or cold?"

**Logic/rational-based:**
- "What are the facts about what happened?"
- "What would someone else see if they looked at this situation?"
- "What information do you have now that you didn't have then?"
- "What would make logical sense here?"

**Concrete/sensory-based:**
- "What sounds are in the black/white?"
- "What textures do you notice?"
- "Can you describe the black/white in more detail?"
- "What would happen if you moved the black/white to one side?"

## Alexithymia

Alexithymia is a personality trait characterised by difficulty identifying, describing, and processing one's own emotions. People with alexithymia may:
- Have trouble recognising what they're feeling
- Struggle to put emotions into words
- Have difficulty distinguishing between emotions and physical sensations
- Experience emotions but not be aware of them
- Focus more on external events than internal emotional states

Alexithymia is more common in autistic individuals but can occur in anyone. It's not a disorder but a trait that can affect how people process and communicate about their emotional experiences.

## Using Cognitive Interweaves with Clients Who Have Alexithymia

**How an EMDR practitioner might adapt interweaves for clients with alexithymia:**

**Avoid emotion-focused interweaves:**
- Instead of "How do you feel about that?" use "What do you notice in your body?"
- Instead of "What emotions come up?" use "What sensations do you notice?"

**Use body sensation-based interweaves:**
- "Where do you feel that in your body?"
- "What does that feel like physically - tight, heavy, hot, cold?"
- "Can you describe the physical sensation without naming an emotion?"
- "What would your body need right now?"

**Use logic/fact-based interweaves:**
- "What are the facts about what happened?"
- "What would make logical sense here?"
- "What information do you have now that you didn't have then?"
- "What would someone observing this situation see?"

**Use concrete/observable interweaves:**
- "What do you see in the image?"
- "What sounds are there?"
- "What would happen if you looked at this from a different angle?"
- "What details can you describe?"

**Use action/behaviour-based interweaves:**
- "What would you do differently now?"
- "What actions could you take?"
- "What would someone else do in this situation?"
- "What would help you feel more in control?"

**Key principle:** Work with what the client can access - body sensations, logic, concrete details, and observable behaviours - rather than asking them to identify or describe emotions they may not be able to recognise.
